### What I learned

Project Description:
In this project, I developed a responsive single-price grid component using HTML and CSS. The layout promotes a subscription service with three key sections: community introduction, pricing, and features.

Responsive Design: I improved my ability to create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using CSS grid and media queries.
CSS Grid: I learned how to effectively use CSS Grid to structure content for larger screens, ensuring a clean, modern design across all devices.

This project helped me achieve a deeper understanding of responsive web design and modern layout techniques.
